### How Session Initiation Protocol Works:

SIP is a signaling protocol used for initiating, modifying, and terminating multimedia sessions such as voice and video calls over IP networks. It operates at the application layer of the OSI model and is text-based, making it human-readable.

SIP works by facilitating communication between endpoints, known as User Agents (UAs), through a series of request-response transactions. These transactions are typically carried out over UDP or TCP transport protocols.

Here's a simplified overview of the SIP process:

1. **User Agent Registration**: A UA registers its current location (IP address) with a SIP server, typically a SIP Registrar server, using a REGISTER request.

2. **Session Establishment**: To initiate a session, a UA sends an INVITE request to the SIP server, specifying the desired recipient's SIP address (URI).

3. **Session Modification**: SIP allows for session modifications, such as adding participants to a call or changing media characteristics. This is achieved through subsequent INVITE or re-INVITE requests.

4. **Session Termination**: When a session ends, either party can send a BYE request to terminate the call. The SIP server then sends a response confirming the termination.

### Python Code to Demonstrate SIP Implementation:

Here's a simple Python code snippet demonstrating how to send a SIP INVITE request using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

# SIP server details
sip_server = "sip.example.com"
sip_port = 5060

# Sender and recipient SIP addresses
sender_uri = "sip:alice@example.com"
recipient_uri = "sip:bob@example.com"

# Construct SIP INVITE request
invite_request = f"INVITE {recipient_uri} SIP/2.0\r\n" \
                 f"Via: SIP/2.0/UDP {sip_server}:{sip_port}\r\n" \
                 f"From: {sender_uri}\r\n" \
                 f"To: {recipient_uri}\r\n" \
                 f"Content-Length: 0\r\n\r\n"

# Send SIP INVITE request
response = requests.request("INVITE", f"http://{sip_server}:{sip_port}", data=invite_request)

# Print SIP server response
print("SIP Server Response:")
print(response.text)
```

This code constructs a SIP INVITE request to initiate a session between two SIP addresses (`sender_uri` and `recipient_uri`). It then sends the request to the SIP server at the specified address and port using the HTTP `requests` library.

Note: This code is a simplified demonstration and does not handle all aspects of SIP protocol intricacies, such as authentication, response handling, and session negotiation. In a real-world scenario, you would use a dedicated SIP library or framework for more robust SIP communication.
